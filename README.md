# TCS_INTERNSHIP-RIO-125-AutomateSentiment-Analysis
Embarking on an exhilarating journey, this internship dives into the realm of teaching computers to decipher emotions from written text. Using the Flipkart customer reviews dataset, we'll delve into deep learning techniques, empowering computers to discern sentiments like happiness, sadness, and more nuanced emotions. Our aim is to equip our digital counterparts with the superpower to accurately interpret the emotional tone of any text, be it a brief message or a lengthy essay. Through this venture, we aim to enhance our computer companions' 
understanding of human emotions, capturing the diverse range of sentiments expressed in written language.
